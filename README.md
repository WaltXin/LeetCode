### Graph
#### 1.Dense Graph
Store with Adjacency Matrix  
Date type: int[][]  
Graph Type: Directed and undirected
#### 2.Sparse Graph
Store with Adjacency List  
Date type: ArrayList<ArrayList\<Integer>>  
Graph Type: Directed and undirected
#### 3.Depth First Search
depth first search through adjacency list
#### 4.Breadth First Search
breadth first search through adjacency list  
The advantage using BFS is you can get the shortest path
### UnionFind
#### UnionFind
union() && find()
#### QuickUnionFind
Bind two union values root and union both root
#### QucikUnionFind With Height
Based on the quick union, add each nodes height  
According to the height, decide which root is the base root
