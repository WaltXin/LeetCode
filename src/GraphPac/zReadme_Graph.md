# Graph
#### 1.Dense Graph
Store with Adjacency Matrix  
Date type: int[][]  
Graph Type: Directed and undirected  
#### 2.Sparse Graph
Store with Adjacency List  
Date type: ArrayList<ArrayList\<Integer>>  
Graph Type: Directed and undirected
#### Depth First Search
depth first search through adjacency list
#### Breadth First Search
breadth first search through adjacency list  
The advantage using BFS is you can get the shortest path
#### Weighted Dense Graph
Add Edge class and change Dense Graph int[][] to Edge[][] for weighted
dense graph
#### Weighted Sparse Graph
Change Sparse Graph ArrayList<ArrayList\<Edge>> for
weighted sparse graph
